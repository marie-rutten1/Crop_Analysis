# ðŸ“Š Analysis of Cropping Trends in India â€“ Focus on Rice Crops

In this analysis, I explore cropping trends in India, paying particular attention to rice crops. The goal is to uncover insights such as:

- How do input factors (like fertilizer and pesticide use) affect crop yield?
- Which states produce the highest average yield for rice?
- How has rice yield changed over the years?

I chose to focus on **rice crops** because, upon exploring the data, I found that rice was the most frequently occurring crop in the dataset, with **1,197 records** across all states.

Additional areas of investigation include:
- Comparing input usage and yield across states.
- Identifying low-input, high-yield combinations.
- Exploring potential lag effects of rainfall on rice yield.
- Looking at trends in production and input efficiency.

This analysis was performed using SQL (PostgreSQL), with plans to visualize and expand on insights using additional tools such as Excel or Power BI.
